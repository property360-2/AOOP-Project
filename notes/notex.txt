Week-by-Week Plan

Week 1: Planning & Design
        Objective: Define scope and requirements.

        Membership Plans
        Payment Processing (Optional)
        Admin Dashboard (View users, track memberships, etc.)
        Booking Classes/Sessions (Optional)
Design a database schema:
        Example Tables: Users, Memberships, Payments, Classes
Create wireframes or mockups of the UI.
Set up project environment:
        Install XAMPP/MAMP for PHP and MySQL.
        Set up a GitHub repo (if version control is needed).
        Organize project folders: /frontend, /backend, /database.

Week 2: Database Setup & Basic Backend Configuration
        Objective: Set up the database and backend.
Create the MySQL database with required tables.
Write initial PHP scripts to connect to the database.
Set up registration and login logic (backend only).
Create reusable PHP components (e.g., header/footer templates).

Week 3: Build Frontend (HTML & CSS)
        Objective: Create the user interface.
Design the homepage, login page, signup page, and membership plan pages.
Use HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling.
Ensure responsiveness using CSS Grid/Flexbox.
Include common UI elements: Navbar, Footer, Forms, Buttons.

Week 4: Add JavaScript to Enhance Frontend
        Objective: Implement frontend interactivity.
Add form validation with JavaScript.
Implement dynamic content updates (like switching between plans).
Integrate basic animations for a smooth user experience.
(Optional) Use AJAX for seamless form submission without page reloads.

Week 5: Develop Core Backend Functionality (PHP)

Complete user authentication (Login/Signup).
        Create a Membership Management System:
Users can select, upgrade, or cancel memberships.

Week 6: Integrate Frontend with Backend
Objective: Make frontend and backend work together.
Connect forms (Login, Signup, Membership selection) to PHP backend.
Ensure session management works properly (Login persistence).
Display dynamic data from the database (e.g., membership status).
(Optional) Add email notifications on signup or membership changes.

Week 7: Testing and Debugging
        Objective: Ensure your project is bug-free and works smoothly.
Test all core functionalities (login, membership updates, etc.).
Conduct UI/UX testing to ensure the app is user-friendly.
Fix any bugs or database issues.
Perform cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

Week 8: Documentation, Final Touches, and Deployment
        Objective: Prepare your project for submission.
Write a README.md explaining how to use the system.
Document the database schema and API endpoints (if any).
Perform final optimizations (clean code, compress assets).
Deploy your project locally (using XAMPP/MAMP) or online (e.g., using Heroku or 000webhost).
Create a presentation/demo for the project submission.
